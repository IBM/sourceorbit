Source Orbit is a dependency management tool. As IBM i developers start using Git for their RPGLE, CL, DDS and SQL, we want to provide them with excellent tools to help them understand their source code. Source orbit is available for use as both a VS Code extension and CLI tool.

## General Usage

Source Orbit will scan the sources in the current working directory (CWD) and can do a few things:

* Show object dependencies with `-l`
* Generate a different file formats based on the dependency tree to build the project
* Rename files easily (`.rpgle`/`.clle`/`.clp` -> `.pgm.rpgle`/`.pgm.clle`/`.clle`) with `-ar`
* Fix RPGLE includes if the source is found locally (useful for converting from member include style) with `-fi`
* List detailed information with `--verbose`
* Want to only scan a specific source? Use the `-s` option: `so -s qrpglesrc/employees.pgm.sqlrpgle`

```sh
cd myibmiproject
so -h
so -bf make && gmake BIN_LIB=libname
```
